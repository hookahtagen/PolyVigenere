## Installation help for PolyVigenere

Thank you for trying out my program. I don't know if it has any use to you but
you're free to check it out. And you can do whatever you want with the code.

For now i really don't have any plans on commercializing anything, but even then:
You're free to go and use it how you like it.

**Polyalphabetic Cipher Encrypter/Decrypter**

This program allows for encryption and decryption of plaintext messages using a polyalphabetic cipher. 
The program uses an alphabet dictionary to define the different alphabets for each character in the key. 
The key is then used to shift the corresponding character in the plaintext by one place for encryption, 
or by one place in reverse for decryption.

**Install**

Actually there is no need to install anything. Just download the files and run the program with python 3.

To do this, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the files. Then run the following command:

```

hendrik@example:~$ /bin/python3 /home/hendrik/Documents/Github/PolyVigenere/src/Vigenere2.0.py
Enter 'e' for encrypt or 'd' for decrypt: e
Enter message: therussiansarecoming
Enter key: abcdefg (<- Is actually hidden in the terminal)
Entered message: therussiansarecoming
Encrypted message:  YWIHPXWBJYOWDKJEURHV
hendrik@example:~$

```

And no, this message is not an actual prediction of the future. It's just a random message i used for testing.<br>
Shut up conspiracy theorists!
