# Introduction

## About the author

What can i say about me?<br>
I'm currently 28 years old and i live in Germany. But i hate such self introductions. So i'll just leave it at that.<br>
After a long time i found my passion to code again. I dunno how but i stuck with python and i'm really enjoying it.<br>
<br>
I'm currently working on a few projects. One of them is this PolyVigenere cipher. I'm also working on a few other projects.<br>
But for now PolyVigenere is the only one i'm willing to share with the world. :D<br>
The other projects are part just for fun and some other are not ready to be shared yet.<br>
<br>
I'm also a big fan of the Linux operating system. I've been using it for a few years now and i'm really enjoying it.<br>
Windows is the best paid virus on the market. :D<br>
But hey, that's just my opinion. <br>
<br>
If you want to contact me, or if you have any questions, feel free to do so.<br>
You can talk to me on [Telegram](https://t.me/hendrik_gerhardt) or you can send me an email.<br>
If i don't answer you within a few days, please contact me again. I might have missed your message.<br>
Or i don't wanna talk to you. :D<br>
<br><br>

## Why did I write this?

That is easy to say:<br>
I wrote this program because i wanted to learn more about python and i wanted to learn more about cryptography.<br>
I also wanted to learn how to use git and github. So i thought i could combine all of this and write a program.<br>
And hey, i did. And i think it turned out pretty good.<br>
<br>
But if you think otherwise, feel free to tell me. I'm always open for criticism.<br>
And if you have any ideas for improvements, feel free to tell me. I'm always open for suggestions.<br>

# What is a polyalphabetic cipher?

A polyalphabetic cipher is a type of encryption technique used in cryptography that substitutes one letter of the plaintext <br> 
with multiple different ciphertext letters. Unlike monoalphabetic ciphers, which use a single fixed substitution for all letters, <br> 
a polyalphabetic cipher uses multiple substitution alphabets to encrypt the message, making it more secure and difficult to crack. <br>
<br>

## How does it work?

The functioning of a polyalphabetic cipher can be understood as follows: The plaintext message is divided into blocks and for each block, <br>
a substitution alphabet is chosen based on the position of a letter in a keyword. The letter in the plaintext is then replaced with its <br>
corresponding ciphertext letter in the substitution alphabet. This process is repeated for each letter in the plaintext, and as a result, <br>
the same letter in the plaintext will have a different ciphertext representation in different blocks. The use of multiple substitution alphabets <br>
makes it more challenging for an attacker to crack the encryption, as the mapping between the plaintext and ciphertext is not constant. This <br>
provides a higher level of security compared to monoalphabetic ciphers, where a single substitution alphabet is used for all letters. <br>
